The site is characterised by one half of the rapids while\nthe other half is a waterfall with the river channel divided by 4.8 kilometres long\nisland before the waterfalls.\nThe site is one of the most scenic geomorphological features located on the\nLuapula River representing a unique land formation. The site also has the largest\nso far known concentration of rock engravings or trace marks in the Republic\nwhich are found on the Katanga geological formation that forms the river bed of\nthe site making the site a potential palaeo-environmental research or archaeological\nresearch.\nThe site is of national significance historically, owing to the site’s important\nhuman and historical association with the European explorer, Victor Giraud, a\nFrench national who sighted it in August, 1883 and of whom the story is told\nthat as Victor Giruad was shooting the waters, he was shot at by the natives. The\nname Mumbotuta is a local name derived from the gashing sound or noise of the\nplunging and rolling waterfalls. The name is also shared by other waterfall sites\nwithin the region. The French Name of this waterfall is Chute Giruad (Giruad\nFalls) which is named after Victor Giruad. Further, it is in these very turbulent\nwaters that a German explorer Paul Graetz lost his craft while trying to cross\nAfrica by boat in 1912.\nBOUNDARY DESCRIPTION\nThe site is located on latitude 12°22’28.14’’ and longitude 29°12’44.08’’ on\nthe Luapula River in Milenge District.
