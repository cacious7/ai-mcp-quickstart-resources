The site\nlies on latitude 10.539852°S and longitude 28.660784°E (10°32’ 23.5\" S28°39’ 38.8\" E) and\ncovers an area of 1.74 square kilometres.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE\nThe site is a rare example of a geomorphic process owing to the water flowing but separated\nby conglomeratic rock that depicts a shrinking river course. This is one of the rare sites in the\nRepublic where a waterfall is formed over conglomeratic rock formation which is a representation\nof an ancient depositional environment (paleo-environment). This rock formation points to the\nimportance of the sedimentary history of the Grand Conglomerate Formation (Central Africa) in\nthe interpretation of the climate during a major Cryogenian glacial event. The scenic beauty and\nnaturalness of the site is also evident in the series of natural splish-splash giving a whitewater\nappearance and soothing sounds in a tranquil setting. The conglomeratic rock formation at the\nsite are a prominently flat river bed with a series of uneven steps which extend into pronounced\nrock outcrops which depict an abandoned ancient river channel with one of the rock outcrops\nforming a gigantic kopje. The gigantic kopje provides evidence of ancient river channel erosional\nand depositional processes that have ended shaping the environment of the site.\nThe site also has an important religious shrine for the Christian Missions in Many Lands on\nthe north-easterly direction.\nBOUNDARY DESCRIPTION\nThe site borders the Democratic Republic of Congo on the south-west and the Republic on the\neastern side. The boundary runs from Point A on the northern bank of Luapula River south of the\nMission; thence the boundary trends in the easterly direction along the river bank to a Point B;\nthence further in a south-easterly direction to Point C and thence to Points D, E, F and G; thence\nrunning parallel the main road to Point H; thence in a westerly direction and towards the river to\nPoint I; thence in a southerly direction to Points J and K; thence in a south-easterly direction to\nPoint L before trending in the westerly direction to Point M on the international boundary\nbetween the Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo; thence in a northerly direction up\nto Point L; thence in a north-easterly direction to the starting Point A.\nThe boundary of the site covers an approximate total area of 1.74 square kilometres.\nThe described area is shown on a plan marked red, signed by the Surveyor-General and\ndeposited in the office of the Surveyor-General and the National Heritage Conservation\nCommission, Lusaka\nR.
