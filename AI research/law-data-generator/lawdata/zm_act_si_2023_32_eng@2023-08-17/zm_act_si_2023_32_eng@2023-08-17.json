The\nsite is located about 1 to 2 kilometres off the Kashikishi - Lunchinda Road, on a rocky hill called\n‘Kabwe’, between Museketwa and Kabwe villages within Senior Chief Puta’s territory in Chiengi\nDistrict, Luapula Province. The Kabwe Hill is approximately 199 metres high and lies at about\n1,152 metres above sea level.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE\nThe site is one of the rare geological formations in the Republic as it has a kopje which towers\nover a considerable height making it one of the most outstanding rock formations in the region and\nthe Republic. The position of the site on top of Kabwe Hill renders the site to be a remarkable\nphysical landmark that is visible from several kilometers away. The geological or geomorphological\nvalue of the site is enhanced by the site being perched on smaller rock outcrops thereby creating\nlarge passage ways or cave tunnels underneath it.\nThe site is also of historical and anthropological significance as it is associated with the customs\nand traditions of the Bwile people under Senior Chief Puta. The site serves as a historical\nlandmark as the rock is reported to have been used as a hiding place by the first Senior Chief\nMununga of the Shila people during the time of war with the Lunda people of Mwata Kazembe’s\nKingdom. Therefore, the site serves as a reminder of the history of tribal conflicts and migration\nof an ethnic grouping that forms an important component of the present day Zambia.\nBOUNDARY DESCRIPTION\nThe site covers an approximate area of 237 hectares. Its boundary starts from Point A at\nlatitude 8°42’51’’S and longitude 29°8’53’’E and trends in a south-easterly direction to Point B\nat latitude 8°43’10\"S and longitude 29°9’19’’E; thence in a south-westerly direction to Point C;\nthence in a northerly direction to latitude 8°44’27’’S and longitude 29°8’33’’E; thence to Point D\nat latitude 8°44’13\"S and longitude 29°8’24’’E and in a northerly direction to Point E at latitude\n8°43’44’’S and longitude 29°8’22’’E, the starting point.\nThe described area is shown on a plan marked red, signed by the Surveyor-General and deposited\nin the office of the Surveyor-General and the National Heritage Conservation Commission, Lusaka.\nR.
