The village, named after the clan totem (crocodile) of\nthe Chitimukulu Royals, marked the end of the Bemba migration from the Congo Basin.\nFrom Ng’wena Village and through conquest of surrounding ethnic groups, Ulubemba grew to\nforty-three semi-autonomous kingdoms. The colonial Government amalgamated the forty-three\nBemba kingdoms into eighteen native reserves which were subsequently named chiefdoms.\nThe mid-18th Century Bemba-Ngoni wars at Ng’wena Village birthed the peace-preserving\nBemba-Ngoni tribal cousinship known by the Bemba people as Bunungwe and by Ngoni people\nas Chimbuya.\nEvery year in August, all the Bemba Kingdoms gather at the centre of the Ng’wena Village for\nUkusefya pa Ng’wena Ceremony which means, festivities at the old Ng’wena Village. Through\nthe ceremony, Bemba people celebrate and re-enact their founding history and pay homage to the\nChitimukulu, the ritualistic and political head of the present-day Bemba Kingdom.\nBOUNDARY DESCRIPTION\nThe described area measuring approximately 707 hectares, is shown on a plan marked red, and\nsigned by the Surveyor-General and deposited in the office of the Surveyor-General and the\nNational Heritage Conservation Commission, Lusaka.\nR. SIKUMBA,\nLUSAKA Minister of Tourism\n11th August, 2023\n[MTA.13/7/1]",
