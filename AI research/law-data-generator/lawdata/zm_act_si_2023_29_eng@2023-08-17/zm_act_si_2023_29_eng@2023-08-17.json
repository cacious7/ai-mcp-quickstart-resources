The\nmain island is found a few meters northwest of the Mwanawasa Bridge. The site is situated at\napproximately 12.410030°S, 29.370325°E and covers a landmass of 7.01square kilometres.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE\nThe site together with the other islands on the Zambian side complemented with those on the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo side form part of the largest island system on the Luapula River.\nThe site is one of the largest islands on the Luapula River and wholly located on the Zambian side.\nThe islands represent the mature stage of a river as depicted in the ox-box lake formation\nprocesses. Thus, it is representative of a mature stage of a river and signifies important on-going\nfluvial geomorphic processes in the history of the formation of the earth in a river channel. The\nsite is one of the most unique geomorphological features representing active geomorphological\nprocesses. The islands have characteristic riverine vegetation which support some avian species\nand play an important ecological role in the micro-ecosystem. The site is a perfect example of an\nopen laboratory for earth scientific and ecological research.\nBOUNDARY DESCRIPTION\nThe boundary of the site starts from Point A (28°41’37.22’’E, 11°58’5.4’’S) further north of\nthe northern bank of Luapula River and on the Zambian side and trends in an easterly direction for\n4.781 kilometres to Point B (28°44’10.95\"E, 11°58’37.84’’S) near Chembe Pedicle Road; thence\nin a southerly direction for 845 metres to Point C (28°43’49.92’’E, 11°58’53.84’’S); thence in a\nsoutherly direction following the Chembe Bridge to an international boundary at Point D\n(28°43’50.05\"E, 11°59’6.58’’S) on the Zambia-Democratic Republic of Congo international\nboundary and in a westerly direction up to Point E (28°41’26.67’’E, 11°58’35.89’’) on the\ninternational boundary before trending in a northerly direction for approximately 982 metres to\nPoint A, the starting point.\nThe described area is shown on a plan marked red, signed by the Surveyor-General and deposited\nin the office of the Surveyor-General and the National Heritage Conservation Commission, Lusaka.\nR.
