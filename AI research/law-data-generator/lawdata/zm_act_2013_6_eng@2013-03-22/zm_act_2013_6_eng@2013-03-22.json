In October 2009, the Government initiated a constraints analysis that identified three main\nbinding constraints to Zambia’s economic growth—\n(i) low quality of human capital;\n(ii) poor infrastructure services; and\n(iii) coordination failures.\nTo elicit feedback on these constraints, the Government undertook a targeted consultative\nprocess in accordance with all applicable MCC policies and guidelines, which included over 500\nrepresentatives from the government, private sector and civil society, as well as the donor\ncommunity. Feedback from these consultations resulted in a list of prioritised sectors deemed to\nbe key to Zambia’s economic development, including ecotourism, hydropower, roads, vocational\nand secondary education and water and sanitation, from which the Government developed and\nsubmitted six concept papers for MCC consideration.\nAfter a thorough examination of the economic and operational feasibility of the Government’s\nconcept papers, MCC and the Government elected to focus solely on improvements to the water\nsupply, sanitation and drainage sectors in the capital city of Lusaka, a key constraint to economic\ngrowth for the country. This examination included further consultations with national and local\ngovernment representatives, technical specialists, non-governmental organisations and the donor\ncommunity, including gender-responsive and socially inclusive consultations with community\nmembers in each of the thirty-three (33) wards directly impacted by the Program. As with the\ninitial consultative process, this effort also was conducted in accordance with all applicable MCC\npolicies and guidelines.\nThe city of Lusaka currently has a population of over one million eight hundred (1,800,000)\npeople, representing over ten (10) percent of Zambia’s total population, and is projected to have\nnearly five million (5,000,000) residents by 2035. This rapidly increasing population is served by\na water supply, sanitation and drainage system that was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s to\nserve a much smaller population, and which has not benefited from major capital investment or\nproper maintenance in the intervening years. As a result, the system’s core infrastructure assets\nare outdated, dilapidated and unable to meet current or future demand. Currently, only\napproximately seventy (70) percent of Lusaka residents have access to treated water supply, and\nonly approximately sixty-five (65) percent have access to water-borne sanitation (either through\na connection to the network or with septic tanks). Those without water-borne sanitation typically\nrely on pit latrines, most of which are not properly designed and therefore result in groundwater\ncontamination, primarily impacting the shallow wells used for drinking water by the population\nwithout access to treated water supply. All of these factors contribute to a high prevalence and\nincidence of water-borne disease, which is exacerbated by endemic flooding resulting from\ninsufficiently maintained and inadequate drainage infrastructure. In addition to poor health, the\ndegraded and inadequate condition of the system’s core infrastructure also forces Lusaka’s residents\nand businesses to waste substantial time and resources resolving water supply shortages and\ndelays, as well as flood losses, resulting in further lost productivity.\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 209\nThe Program is designed to address this constraint to economic growth by supporting\ninfrastructure investments and continued institutional strengthening and reform in order to expand\naccess to, and improve the reliability of, water supply and sanitation, and improve drainage\nservices in select urban and peri-urban areas of the city of Lusaka. To this end, the Program has\nbeen developed within the broader framework of, and is consistent with, Zambia’s “National\nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation Program,” and, as further described in paragraph 7 of Part B\nof this Annex I, complements the Government’s longstanding and successful efforts to reform the\nwater and sanitation and drainage sectors. These reform efforts have produced a variety of key\noutcomes, which have laid the foundation for the Program, including, for example, the privatisation\nof state-owned enterprises to create commercial utilities throughout the country, as well as the\nimplementation of cost reflective tariffs, as facilitated through the creation of an autonomous\nwater utility regulator, the National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (“NWASCO”).\n2. Project Objective\nThe Program consists of the Lusaka Water Supply, Sanitation And Drainage Project, (the\n“LWSSD Project” or the “Project”), which in turn consists of the Infrastructure Activity and\nthe Institutional Strengthening Activity, as each is further described in this Annex 1.\nThe Project Objective is to expand access to, and improve the reliability of, water supply and\nsanitation, and improve drainage services in select urban and peri-urban areas of the city of\nLusaka in order to decrease the incidence of water-borne and water-related diseases, generate time\nsavings for households and businesses and reduce non-revenue water in the water supply network.\n3. Environmental and Social Safeguards\nThe Program will be implemented in compliance with the MCC Environmental Guidelines, the\nInternational Finance Corporation’s Social and Environmental Performance Standards (the “IFC\nPerformance Standards”), the MCC Gender Policy and the MCC Gender Integration Guidelines\nand Operational Procedures. Any involuntary resettlement will be carried out in accordance with\nIFC Performance Standard 5 on Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement in a manner\nacceptable to MCC. The Government will also ensure that the Program complies with all national\nenvironmental laws and regulations, licences and permits, except to the extent such compliance\nwould be inconsistent with this Compact. Specifically, the Government will:\n(a) cooperate with or complete, as the case may be, any on-going environmental and social\nimpact assessments, or, if necessary, undertake and complete any additional\nenvironmental and social assessments, environmental and social management plans,\nhealth and safety management plans, environmental and social audits and resettlement\naction plans required under the laws of Zambia, the MCC Environmental Guidelines,\nthe IFC Performance Standards, this Compact, the Program Implementation\nAgreement, or any other Supplemental Agreement, or as otherwise required by\nMCC, each in form and substance satisfactory to MCC;\n(b) ensure that Project-(and, as applicable Activity-) specific environmental and social\nmanagement plans and health and safety management plans are developed and all\nrelevant measures contained in such plans are integrated into project design, the\napplicable procurement documents and associated finalised contracts, in each case,\nin form and substance satisfactory to MCC; and\n(c) implement to MCC’s satisfaction appropriate environmental, social, health and safety\nmitigation measures identified in such assessments or plans or developed to address\nenvironmental, social, health and safety issues identified during implementation.\nUnless MCC agrees otherwise in writing, the Government will fund all necessary\ncosts of environmental and social mitigation measures (including, without limita-\ntion, costs of resettlement) not specifically provided for, or that exceed the MCC\nFunding specifically allocated for such costs, in the Detailed Financial Plan for the\nProgram.\n210 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\nTo maximise the positive social impacts of the Program, address cross-cutting social and gender\nissues such as human trafficking, child and forced labour and HIV/AIDS, and ensure compliance\nwith the MCC Gender Policy, the Government will—\n(a) adhere to the MCC Gender Integration Guidelines and Operational Procedures;\n(b) develop a comprehensive social and gender integration plan (“Social and Gender\nIntegration Plan”), in form and substance satisfactory to MCC and reflecting the\nMCC Social and Gender Integration Plan Guidelines, which, at a minimum, identifies\napproaches for regular, meaningful and inclusive consultations with women and\nother vulnerable/under-represented groups, consolidates the findings and\nrecommendations of the Project- (and, as applicable, Activity-) specific social and\ngender analyses and social and gender-focused sub-activities, and sets forth strategies\nfor incorporating findings of the social and gender analyses into final designs, as\nappropriate; and\n(c) ensure, through monitoring and coordination during implementation, that final Project\n(and Activity) designs, construction tender documents, other bidding documents\nand implementation plans are consistent with and incorporate the outcomes of the\nsocial and gender analyses and the Social and Gender Integration Plan.\nB. LUSAKA WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND DRAINAGE PROJECT\nSet forth below is a description of the LWSSD Project that the Government will implement, or\ncause to be implemented, using MCC Funding;\n1. Summary of Project and Activities\nThe LWSSD Project is comprised of the fol1owing activities (each, an “Activity”):\nInvestments in infrastructure development and rehabilitation, including interventions\nto rehabilitate the core water supply network, rehabilitate and expand select water supply\nand sewage networks, reduce Non-Revenue Water (“NRW’) and improve select drainage\ninfrastructure (the “Infrastructure Activity”).\nThe provision of technical assistance to the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company\n(“LWSC”), the provincial utility responsible for the management of Lusaka’s water and\nsanitation assets and for the provision of water and sanitation services, and the Lusaka\nCity Council (“LCC’), the Government entity that manages the city’s drainage infrastructure\nand services. This Activity will also include support for comprehensive information,\neducation and communication campaigns, and a competitive grant program designed to\nspur innovation in the sectors (the “Institutional Strengthening Activity”).\n(a) Infrastructure Activity\nThe Infrastructure Activity consists of a series of infrastructure improvements to\nprioritized water supply, sanitation and drainage assets in Lusaka. Each component of this\nActivity related to water supply and sanitation was selected based on the results of\nmutually agreed, comprehensive investment master plans, while the component of this\nActivity related to drainage was selected based on the results of priorities identified in the\n“Study on Comprehensive Urban Development Plan for the City of Lusaka in the Republic\nof Zambia” funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (the “Comprehensive\nUrban Development Plan”). All components were also selected based on the results of\nmutually agreed, substantially completed feasibility studies on a subset of priority projects\nidentified in the plans. Collectively, during the Compact Term, the investments under this\nActivity are expected to increase available water supply from 225 to 240 million liters per\nday and reduce NRW from 48 percent to an estimated 25 percent. In addition, approximately\n150,000 new people are expected to benefit from the water system (either through new\nhousehold connections or kiosks) and the number of sanitation connections is expected to\nincrease from approximately 22,000 to approximately 38,000. Specifically, the Infrastructure\nActivity includes the following sub-activities:\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 211\n(i) Core Water Network Rehabilitation: This sub-activity is designed to rehabilitate\nthe core water supply network in Lusaka in order to upgrade key treatment\nand distribution centers and distribution lines and to reduce NRW.

Primary infrastructure works to be supported by MCC Funding\nunder this sub-activity are expected to include, without limitation:\n212 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\n(l) the upsizing of the existing primary outfall and main drain channels;\n(2) the stabilization of the newly up sized drainage channels; and\n(3) as needed, the installation of protective handrails.\n(b) Institutional Strengthening Activity\nThe Institutional Strengthening Activity consists of a series of investments designed to\nincrease the ability of LWSC and LCC to maintain and manage their respective infrastructure\nassets and to more effectively and equitably deliver services to Lusaka residents, as well as\nto support innovation in water, sanitation and drainage-related activities.\nSpecifically, the Institutional Strengthening Activity includes the following sub-activities:\n(i) Support to LWSC: This sub-activity is focused on strengthening the capacity of\nLWSC to, without limitation, undertake comprehensive asset management\nplanning and execution, carry out effective environmental management and\nmonitoring, institutionalize and improve gender mainstreaming and conduct\neffective outreach to ensure pro-poor water sanitation service delivery. MCC\nFunding for this sub-activity is intended to support:\n(1) The provision of technical assistance and related equipment to improve\nLWSC’s maintenance capacity and capability, including, without\nlimitation, the creation of an asset register and improvement of\nLWSC’ s electronic data and management systems, and the provision\nof comprehensive training to improve maintenance budgeting and\nforecasting, as well as to determine the most effective modality for\ncarrying out LWSC’s maintenance responsibilities.\n(2) The provision of technical assistance and, potentially, related equipment\nto strengthen LWSC’ s capacity to ensure effective environmental\nmonitoring, quality management and compliance.\n(3) The provision of technical assistance to better institutionalize and\nstrengthen LWSC’s capacity for gender mainstreaming and social\ninclusion, and to develop and implement policies that will increase\nLWSC’ s capacity and incentives to provide affordable services to\nthe peri-urban poor and vulnerable populations.\n(4) Support for LWSC-managed information, education and\ncommunications (“IEC’) efforts to promote behavior change and\ncare of physical assets, including financial obligations.\n(ii) Support to LCC: This sub-activity is focused on strengthening the capacity of\nLCC to, without limitation, better manage and maintain its drainage assets, to\nimprove environmental management and monitoring, to institutionalize and\nimprove gender mainstreaming and to conduct effective outreach. MCC\nFunding for this sub-activity is intended to support:\n(1) The provision of technical assistance to increase LCC’s capacity to\nplan and maintain Lusaka’s overall drainage system, including,\nwithout limitation, the development of a comprehensive operations\nand maintenance program, the completion of an institutional needs\nassessment and support to implement the recommendations thereof,\nand support for a detailed ground water study to guide future\nsystem-wide operation and maintenance decision-making and\ncoherent, further infrastructure investments.\n(2) The provision of technical assistance and, potentially, related equipment\nto strengthen LCC’s capacity to ensure effective environmental\nmonitoring, quality management of drainage infrastructure and to\nintegrate environmental management into its broader governance\nstructure.\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 213\n(3) The provision of technical assistance to better institutionalize and\nstrengthen LCC’s capacity for gender mainstreaming and to better\nunderstand and mitigate social and behavioral conditions that may\ncontribute to degraded drainage infrastructure.\n(4) Support for LCC-managed IEC efforts to promote behavior change\nand care of physical assets to ensure the realization of expected\nProject-related health benefits and the sustain ability of the\nCompact’s infrastructure investments.\n(iii) Innovation Grant Program for Pro-Poor Service Delivery: This subactivity\nwill support a competitive grant and partnership program designed to identify,\nand provide assistance to, innovative partnership opportunities, particularly\nthrough private sector engagement. This sub-activity is intended to increase\nand sustain the poor’s access to quality water and sanitation, improve water\nuse, sanitation and hygiene practices among the poor, strengthen tenure security\nand capacity for community-based planning, provide significant access by\nwomen and vulnerable groups to Project benefits and expand opportunities\nfor entrepreneurship and income generating activities related to water,\nsanitation and drainage.\nActivities will thus enhance the functioning of the systems, complementing\nand supplementing the Compact’s other investments. Grants issued under\nthis sub-activity will be awarded, implemented and managed pursuant to\nopen, fair and competitive procedures administered in a transparent manner\nin accordance with all relevant MCC policies and guidelines (including the\nProgram Guidelines, the MCC Gender Integration Guidelines and Operational\nProcedures and the IFC Performance Standards). Prior to the Disbursement\nof any MCC Funding for a Grant, MCC and the Government will agree on an\noperations manual including procedures to govern the identification of potential\nGrant recipients, including, without limitation, appropriate eligibility and\nselection criteria and award procedures. The Parties will also agree on the\npossibility of appointing an outside grant program manager. Unless otherwise\napproved by MCC, Grants awarded under this component will not be used\nto support infrastructure investments.\n2. Beneficiaries\nThe LWSSD Project is expected to benefit approximately 1,240,000 individuals over twenty\nyears, which represents the projected total population in Lusaka expected to benefit from at least\none of the Activities. Of these beneficiaries, approximately 73 percent are expected to be poor,\nwhich is defined as living on less than US$2.00 per day on a purchasing power parity basis. The\nmain channels through which these beneficiaries are expected to benefit from the LWSSD Project\nare through time savings, improved health outcomes and a reduction in NRW.\n3. Environmental and Social Mitigation Measures\nThe Infrastructure Activity under the LWSSD Project has been classified as a Category “B”\nproject in accordance with the MCC Environmental Guidelines and the IFC Performance Standards.\nThis categorization is based on a number of risks and impacts, most of which are site-specific,\nrelatively minor and can be readily mitigated through site-specific environmental and social\nmanagement plans. Specifically, environmental and social impacts assessments completed for the\nInfrastructure Activity have confirmed that the majority of the anticipated environmental and\nsocial impacts are positive in nature. However, these assessments also identified the following\npotential environmental- and social-related challenges and impacts that must be managed carefully\nthrough effective project design, implementation and monitoring:\n214 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\nInvoluntary Resettlement: The Infrastructure Activity is anticipated to result in the\nphysical and/or economic displacement of approximately 1,800 households due to Project-\nrelated land use and acquisition, although most of these households will only experience\nminor or temporary resettlement or displacement. A resettlement policy framework has\nalready been developed for the Project and site-specific resettlement action plans will be\ndeveloped once project designs are complete.\nCommunity and Worker Health and Safety: In addition to the typical occupational\nhealth and safety risks for construction workers, the major risks involve ensuring the\nsafety of residents in the areas where construction activities will require the excavation of\ntrenches, which may involve the use of explosives, in densely populated areas. Mitigation\nof these risks will be addressed through health and safety management plans, which will\ninclude requirements for intense safety training and supervision and extensive on going\ncoordu1ation with local community organizations.\nSludge Removal and Disposal: The upgrade and expansion of the sewerage network\nand the rehabilitation and expansion of the sewage stabilization ponds will generate additional\nsewage sludge. LWSC’s ability to adequately monitor and manage, and properly dispose\nof, this additional sewage sludge will be strengthened through the environmental management\nsub-activity of the Institutional Strengthening Activity.\nWater Quality and Effluent Monitoring: In order to ensure the well-being and\nenvironmental health of Lusaka residents it is critical that drinking water and effluent from\nthe sewage ponds regularly meet national standards. LWSC’s, and, as appropriate, LCC’s,\nability to adequately monitor and manage water and effluent quality will be strengthened\nthrough the environmental management sub-activity of the Institutional Strengthening\nActivity.\nWaste collection and Management: One of the principal issues affecting effective drain\noperation is the blockage of culverts by accumulated solid waste. In order to mitigate the\nrisk associated with underperforming drainage infrastructure due to inadequate solid waste\nmanagement, the Institutional Strengthening Activity includes support to enhance LCC’s\ndrainage-related solid waste and environmental management capabilities.\nThe Institutional Strengthening Activity has been classified as a Category “D” project, as it will\ninvolve, among other components, an innovation Grant sub-activity through which MCC Funding\nwill be used to provide assistance to selected Grant recipients for projects that may result in\nadverse environmental and social impacts. However, unless otherwise approved by MCC, Grants\nawarded under this component will not be used to support infrastructure-based investments, and\nas such, are not expected to result in any significant environmental, health or safety hazards.\nNonetheless, prior to disbursing any Grants under the innovation Grant subactivity, MCA-\nZambia will be required to develop and implement an environmental management system that is\nconsistent with the MCC Environmental Guidelines and the IFC Performance Standards, as well\nas any applicable Government regulatory requirements.\n4. Donor Coordination\nMCC and the Government have actively communicated and coordinated with other donors\nthroughout the development of the Compact, and these efforts will continue during implementation.\nThe World Bank is one of the main donors currently working in Lusaka’s water sector. In fact, the\nGovernment’s “Water Sector Performance Improvement Project,” which has been implemented\nwith assistance from the World Bank, has laid much of the sector reform groundwork that has led\nto improved performance by LWSC.\nIn addition to the World Bank’s sector reform efforts, and as noted elsewhere, each component\nof the Infrastructure Activity related to water supply and sanitation was selected based on the\nresults of mutually agreed, comprehensive investment master plans financed by MCC during\ndevelopment of this Compact, while the component of the Activity related to drainage was\nselected based on the results of priorities identified in the Comprehensive Urban Development\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 215\nPlan. MCC and the Government have used these investment master plans to stimulate interest in\nthe water supply and sanitation sector among the donor community, including by hosting a donor\nforum. While firm commitments have not yet been made for additional investments outlined in the\ninvestment master plans, the Government has been in dialogue with donors such as the European\nInvestment Bank, the African Development Bank and the Japanese International Cooperation\nAgency with regard to further investments in Lusaka’s water supply and sanitation sector.\n5. USAlD\nMCC has been in a continuing dialogue with the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (“USAID”) throughout the development of this Compact. Specifically, MCC and\nUSAID have discussed potential, complementary investments by USAlD through its “Sustainable\nWater and Sanitation in Africa Program,” which may include focused capacity building for NWASCO\nthat would support the Compact objectives.\n6. Sustainability\nThe long-term sustainability of the water and sanitation infrastructure improvements funded\nunder the Infrastructure Activity is expected to be reinforced by several factors and elements of\nthe Project’s design. First, LWSC currently recovers 102 percent if its operating costs, and the\nnew water connections anticipated under the Infrastructure Activity are expected to increase the\nfinancial health of the utility. In addition, the Government, with support from the World Bank,\nhas implemented the “Water Sector Performance Improvement Project,” which has positively\ncontributed to the financial performance of LWSC. Related to this, the Government and LWSC\nhave agreed to enter into the LWSC Sustainability Agreement as a condition precedent to the entry\ninto force of this Compact, which will set forth certain operational and financial performance\nmilestones for LWSC and the sector. The continued effectiveness of, and compliance with, the\nLWSC Sustainability Agreement, including satisfaction of the applicable performance milestones,\nis a condition precedent to the Disbursement of MCC Funding under the Program Implementation\nAgreement. Also, the technical assistance provided under the Institutional Strengthening Activity\nis designed to help LWSC better plan for maintenance and asset renewal. Finally, as a condition to\nentry into force of this Compact and as a condition to subsequent Disbursements of MCC\nFunding, LWSC will be required to devote a minimum of 50 percent of its annual retained earnings\nto asset renewal.\nThe long-term sustainability of the drainage infrastructure improvements funded under the\nInfrastructure Activity is expected to be reinforced by several factors and elements of the Project’s\ndesign. First, the Program includes a condition precedent requiring LCC to allocate a minimum of\nUS$I.5 million on an annual basis to be used exclusively for repair and maintenance of drains, as\nfurther described in the Program Implementation Agreement. Similarly, technical assistance\nprovided to LCC under the Institutional Strengthening Activity is designed to improve its ability\nto manage and maintain its assets.\nIn addition, sustainability will be addressed across the entire Program through the IEC activities\nunder the Institutional Strengthening Activity. These include the IEC focus on maintenance and\ncare of community-level infrastructure and payment for services, and the focus on health and\nhygiene-related knowledge and behavior, both of which are critical to ensuring the sustainability\nof the Program’s infrastructure investments and benefits over time.\n7. Policy, Legal and Regulatory Reforms\nThe Government has been pursuing a reform agenda of privatization and deregulation of state\nowned enterprises since the advent of a new democratic government in 1991. Following this\ntrend, the Government developed its first comprehensive National Water Policy in 1994. The\npolicy was followed by the enactment of the Water Supply and Sanitation Act in 1997, which led\nto the creation of NWASCO. To harmonize various water sector issues, the Government updated\nits National Water Policy in 2010, and also enacted the Water Resources Management Act in\n2011. Key outcomes of these developments have been the creation of commercial utilities\nthroughout the country, including LWSC, a move towards full cost recovery tariffs, better water\nresource management and more independent regulation of the water supply and sanitation utilities.\n216 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\nBy embracing a reform agenda, the Government has invested political capital to build a strong\nfoundation for the water sector in order to expand and serve the needs of its population. As a\nresult of the Government’s policy reform efforts and the creation of appropriate regulatory and\ninstitutional foundations, LWSC and other commercial utilities are starting to perform better, and\nthe sector is being more effectively regulated. Where LWSC and other commercial utilities need\nassistance now is in the area of new capital to expand their networks and rehabilitate old\ninfrastructure.\nGiven the significant policy reform already undertaken by the Government in this area, including\nthrough continued, sustained support from other donors, such as the World Bank, no major\nspecific sector policy reforms are included under the Compact. However, MCC will monitor the\nGovernment and LWSC’s compliance with the reform requirements, performance milestones and\nrelated best practices required under the LWSC Sustainability Agreement, which must be entered\ninto by the Government and LWSC as a condition precedent to the entry into force of this\nCompact.\nIn addition, in light of concerns about the ability of poor households to afford the household\nsanitation connections constructed under the Compact, the Government is required to deliver the\nGRZ Sanitation Connection Action Plan as a condition precedent to the entry into force of this\nCompact, and satisfactory implementation of the GRZ Sanitation Connection Action Plan,\nincluding the commitment of appropriate funding by the Government, is a condition precedent to\nsubsequent Disbursements of MCC Funding, as further described in the Program Implementation\nAgreement. The GRZ Sanitation Connection Action Plan must include, without limitation, a\nmethodology for determining who qualifies for such assistance and a plan for administering such\nassistance and ensuring that such beneficiaries obtain household connections.\nC. IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK\n1. Overview\nThe implementation framework and the plan for ensuring adequate governance, oversight,\nmanagement, monitoring and evaluation and fiscal accountability for the use of MCC Funding are\nsurnmarized below. MCC and the Government will enter into the Program Implementation\nAgreement and any other agreements in furtherance of this Compact, all of which, together with\nthis Compact, set out certain rights, responsibilities, duties and other terms relating to the\nimplementation of the Program.\n2.

Program Logic\nThe M&E Plan will be built on the logic model below, which illustrates how the Program, the\nProject and the Activities contribute to the Compact Goal and the Project objective.\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 223\ns\ns\n224 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\nfo\ndnE\nenilesaB\nnoitinifeD\nrotacidnI\ntluseR\ntcapmoC\neulaV\nnoisnapxE\ndna\nnoitatilibaheR\nerutcurtsarfnI\nylppuS\nretaW\n097,61\n0\ndlohesuoh\nwen\nfo rebmuN\not\nsseccA\nretaw\ndevorpmI\nkrowten\nretaw\neht ot\nsnoitcennoc\nretaw\ndevorpmi\negarevoc\nsecivres\neht\nhguorht\nelbissop\nedam\nylppus\ntcapmoc\n42\n71\nyad\nrep\ndecivres\nfo sruoh\negarevA\nfo\nytiunitnoC\nylppus\nretaw\nrof\necivres\nytilauq\ndevorpmI\n000,042\n000,522\ndecudorp\nretaw\nfo\nemulov\nlatoT\nretaw\nfo\nemuloV\nyreviled\necivres\nfo\neht\nrof\nyad\nrep sretem\ncibuc\nni\ndecudorp\naera\necivres\n%52\n%84\nretaw\nneewteb\necnereffid\nehT\neunever-noN\nretaw\ndecudeR\n.e.i(\ndlos\nretaw\ndna\ndeilppus\nretaw\nsessol\ndesserpxe\n)”tsol“\nretaw\nfo emulov\ndeilppus\nretaw\nfo egatnecrep\na\nsa\n5.9\n61\ndlohesuoh\nyb\ntneps\nemit\negarevA\ntneps\nemiT\nrof\nsgnivas\nemiT\neht\nni\nretaw\nhctef\not\nsrebmem\nretaw\ngnihctef\nsdlohesuoh\ndetagerggasid(\n)sruoh(\nkeew\ntsap\n)xes\nyb\n745,1\n273,1\nnoitubirtsid\neht fo\nhtgnel\nlatoT\neht\nfo\nhtgneL\nmk\nni krowten\nnoitubirtsid\nretaw\n)mk(\nkrowten\nretaw\ndevorpmI\n695\n235\n,dekrowten-non\nfo\nrebmun\nehT\nstniop\nretaW\nylppus\nylppus\nretaw\nenola\n-dnats\ndetcurtsnoc\nerutcurtsarfni\n)sksoik(\ndetcurtsnoc\nsmetsys\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 225\nfo\ndnE\nenilesaB\nnoitinifeD\nrotacidnI\ntluseR\ntcapmoC\neulaV\nnoisnapxE\ndna\nnoitatilibaheR\nerutcurtsarfnI\nnoitatinaS\n741,31\n0\ndlohesuoh\nwen\nfo\nrebmuN\not\nsseccA\ndevorpmI\nkrowten\negarewes\not\nsnoitcennoc\ndevorpmi\nnoitatinas\neht\nhguorht\nelbissop\nedam\nnoitatinas\negarevoc\ntcapmoc\n094\n804\negarewes\neht\nfo\nhtgnel\nlatoT\neht\nfo\nhtgneL\ndevorpmI\nmk\nni\nkrowten\nmetsys\nrewes\nnoitatinas\nerutcurtsarfni\nfo\ndnE\nenilesaB\nnoitinifeD\nrotacidnI\ntluseR\ntcapmoC\neulaV\nnoitatilibaheR\nerutcurtsarfnI\neganiarD\n03\n0\nlennahc\neganiard\nfo\nmk\nlatoT\neht\nfo\nhtgneL\ndevorpmI\neht\nyb\ndednuf\nnoitatilibaher\nmetsys\neganiard\nmetsys\neganiard\ntcapmoC\n226 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\n(a) Data Collection and Reporting: The M&E Plan will establish guidelines for data collection\nand reporting, and identify the responsible parties. Compliance with data collection\nand reporting timelines will be conditions for Disbursements for the relevant Activities\nas set forth in the Program Implementation Agreement. The M&E Plan will specify\nthe data collection methodologies, procedures, and analysis required for reporting\non results at all levels. The M&E Plan will describe any interim MCC approvals for\ndata collection, analysis, and reporting plans;\n(b) Data Quality Reviews: As determined in the M&E Plan or as otherwise requested by\nMCC, the quality of the data gathered through the M&E Plan will be reviewed to\nensure that data reported are as valid, reliable, and timely as resources will allow.\nThe objective of any data quality review will be to verify the quality and the\nconsistency of performance data across different implementation units and reporting\ninstitutions. Such data quality reviews also will serve to identify where those levels\nof quality are not possible, given the realities of data collection;\n(c) Management Information System: The M&E Plan will describe the information system\nthat will be used to collect data, store, process and deliver information to relevant\nstakeholders in such a way that the Program information collected and verified\npursuant to the M&E Plan is at all times accessible and useful to those who wish to\nuse it. The system development will take into consideration the requirement and\ndata needs of the components of the Program, and will be aligned with existing MCC\nsystems, other service providers, and ministries;\n(d) Role of MCA-Zambia: The monitoring and evaluation of this Compact spans one\nProject and will involve governmental, nongovernmental, and private sector\ninstitutions. In accordance with the designation contemplated by Section 3.2(b) of\nthis Compact, MCA-Zambia is responsible for implementation of the M&E Plan.\nMCA-Zambia will oversee all Compact related monitoring and evaluation activities\nconducted for the Project, ensuring that data from all implementing entities is\nconsistent, accurately reported and aggregated into regular Compact performance\nreports as described in the M&E Plan.\n4. Evaluation Component\nThe Evaluation Component of the M&E Plan will contain three types of evaluations: (i)\nimpact evaluations; (ii) project performance evaluations; and (iii) special studies. The Evaluation\nComponent of the M&E Plan will describe the purpose of the evaluation, methodology, timeline,\nrequired MCC approvals, and the process for collection and analysis of data for each evaluation.\nThe results of all evaluations will be made publicly available in accordance with the MCC Policy\nfor Monitoring and Evaluation of Compacts and Threshold Programs.\nPossible evaluations include:\nInfrastructure Activity: An evaluation of this activity would focus on household level\nimpacts including health outcomes and expenditures; time savings; property values; and\nthe availability and reliability of water, sanitation, and drainage services. Although a specific\nmethodology has not been identified, due to the high potential for learning from these\ninvestments, MCC and MCA-Zambia will work together to develop as rigorous an\nevaluation of the infrastructure investments as possible.\nInstitutional Strengthening Activity. The Institutional Strengthening Activities would\nlikely undergo performance evaluations aimed at assessing their effectiveness and contribution\nto the overall sustainability of the infrastructure investments.\nInnovation Grant Program: The innovation grant (IG) program under the Institutional\nStrengthening Activity will seek opportunities to rigorously evaluate the activities that are\nproposed for funding. To the extent the IG program supports innovative ideas in the realm\nof water, sanitation, and drainage services, rigorous evaluations would serve an accountability\nfunction and, if possible, a learning function.\nMillennium Challenge Compact [No. 6 of 2013 227\n(a) Impact Evaluation: The M&E Plan will include a description of the methods to be used\nfor impact evaluations and plans for integrating the evaluation method into Project\ndesign. Final impact evaluation strategies are to be included in the M&E Plan.\n(b) Final Evaluation: The M&E Plan will make provision for final Project-level evaluations\n(“Final Evaluations”). With the prior written approval of MCC, the Government\nwill engage independent evaluators to conduct the Final Evaluations at the end of the\nProject. The Final Evaluations will review progress during Compact implementation\nand provide a qualitative context for interpreting monitoring data and impact evaluation\nfindings. They must at a minimum—\n(i) evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the Activities;\n(ii) determine if and analyze the reasons why the Compact Goal and the Project\nObjective, outcome(s) and output(s) were or were not achieved;\n(iii) identify positive and negative unintended results of the Program;\n(iv) provide lessons learned that may be applied to similar projects; and\n(v) assess the likelihood that results will be sustained over time.\n(i) Special Studies: The M&E Plan will include a description of the methods to be\nused for special studies, as necessary, funded through this Compact or by\nMCC. Plans for conducting the special studies will be determined jointly\nbetween the Government and MCC before the approval of the M&E Plan.\nThe M&E Plan will identify and make provision for any other special\nstudies, ad hoc evaluations, and research that may be needed as part of the\nmonitoring and evaluating of this Compact. Either MCC or the Government\nmay request special studies or ad hoc evaluations of the Project, the\nActivities, or the Program as a whole prior to the expiration of the Compact\nTerm. When the Government engages an evaluator, the engagement will be\nsubject to the prior written approval of MCC. Contract terms must ensure\nnon-biased results and the publication of results.\n(c) Request for Ad Hoc Evaluation or Special Study, If the Government requires an ad hoc\nindependent evaluation or special study at the request of the Government for any\nreason, including for the purpose of contesting an MCC determination with respect\nto the Project or any Activity or to seek funding from other donors, no MCC\nFunding resources may be applied to such evaluation or special study without\nMCC’s prior written approval.\n5. Other Components of the M and E Plan\nIn addition to the monitoring and evaluation components, the M&E Plan will include the\nfollowing components for the Program, the Project and the Activities, including, where appropriate,\nroles and responsibilities of the relevant parties and providers:\n(a) Costs: A detailed cost estimate for all components of the M and E Plan; and\n(b) Assumptions and Risks: Any assumption or risk external to the Program that underlies\nthe accomplishment of the Project Objective and Activity outcomes and outputs.\nHowever, such assumptions and risks will not excuse any Party’s performance\nunless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by the other Party.\n6. Approval and Implementation of the M and E Plan\nThe approval and implementation of the M&E Plan, as amended from time to time, will be in\naccordance with the Program Implementation Agreement, any other relevant Supplemental\nAgreement and the MCC Policy for Monitoring and Evaluation of Compacts and Threshold\nprogramme\n228 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challenge Compact\nANNEX IV\nCONDITIONS PRECEDENT\nTo Disbursement of Compact Implementation Funding\nThis Annex IV sets forth the conditions precedent applicable to Disbursements of Compact\nImplementation Funding other than Disbursements for MCC CIF Contracted Activities (each a\n“CIF Disbursement”).

Introduction\nIn accordance with, and without limiting the generality of, Section 2.8 of the Compact, the\nGovernment will ensure that all MCC Funding is free from the payment or imposition of any\nexisting or future Taxes in or of Zambia. This will include any interest or earnings on MCC\nFunding, and any MCC Funding disbursed, directly or indirectly, to or for:\n(i) MCA-Zambia;\n(ii) any goods, works, services, technology and other assets and activities under the Program\nor the Project;\n(iii) any persons and entities, including without limitation any Implementing Entity,\ncontractor (prime and subcontractors), consultant or grantees, that provide such\ngoods, works, services, technology and assets, or perform such activities (each, a\n“Vendor”); and/or\n(iv) any income, profits, and payments with respect to the foregoing, except as otherwise\nallowed pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Compact.\nThis Annex VI sets out the mechanisms for exempting MCC Funding from the principal Taxes\notherwise imposed by the Government. Should any potential liability for Taxes on MCC Funding\narise that is not contemplated by the mechanisms set out in this Annex VI, the Parties will, in\naccordance with Section 2.8 of the Compact, agree to the means by which MCC Funding will be\nexempt from such Taxes.\nFor the purposes of this Annex VI, MCA-Zambia and any Vendor are referred to variously as\n“Eligible Entities” or “Eligible Individuals,” as appropriate.\nIn addition, for the purposes of this Annex VI, any Compact-related contracts, agreements or\ngrants with an Eligible Entity or Eligible Individual are referred to as a “Compact Contract.”\n2. General Background\nFor most Tax exemptions or Tax rebates, the applicable tax-related laws of Zambia (the\n“Applicable Acts”) have vested powers in the Minister of Finance and National Planning to grant\nsuch exemptions or rebates through the issuance of subsidiary legislation, each referred to as a\n“Statutory Instrument.” For every Statutory Instrument that is issued in respect of a tax exemption\nor rebate, the Minister of Finance and National Planning submits an explanatory memorandum to\nthe Committee on Delegated Legislation of Parliament. The memorandum explains why the\nStatutory Instrument has been issued.\nIn general, MCC Funding will be treated in accordance with the provisions of donor-funded\nprojects, under which there is authority to exempt any goods, services or works that are purchased\nusing such funds from taxation in Zambia. In terms of income tax and other exemptions, for which\nexisting exemption mechanisms are not specifically referenced in the Applicable Acts, the Minister\nof Finance and National Planning will issue a specific Statutory Instrument.\n3. Miscellaneous Additional Requirements\nFor the purposes of determining if a natural person is a permanent resident of Zambia or if a\nlegal person has been formed under the laws of Zambia under Section 2.8(a) of the Compact, the\ntaxable status of such natural or legal person will be based on its status at the time it is awarded\nor executes a Compact-related agreement, contract, or grant, and such initial determination will\nnot change regardless of:\n(i) the type of agreement, contract or grant used to employ or engage such natural or legal\nperson;\n(ii) any laws of Zambia that purport to change such status based on period of contract or\ngrant performance, or period of time residing and/or working in Zambia; and/or\n234 No. 6 of 2013] Millennium Challege Compact\n(iii) any requirement under the laws of Zambia that a company or other legal person must\nestablish a branch office in Zambia, or otherwise register or organize itself under the\nlaws of Zambia, in order to provide goods, works or services in Zambia.\nIn addition, in complying with the tax exemption obligations set forth in the Compact, the\nGovernment will also exempt MCA-Zambia, the Fiscal Agent, the Procurement Agent and/or any\nother Vendor from any obligation imposed by the laws of Zambia, including the Applicable Acts,\nto withhold any Taxes from any payments made to any Eligible Entities or Eligible Individuals.\n4.
